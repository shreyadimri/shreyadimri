### Hi there 👋
##### I am Shreya (she/her)
##### a PhD Student in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Bielefeld University , Germany!
##### I am currently working with evidence synthesis methodology (meta-analysis/systematic reviews) 
##### I am a supreme imposter - some days I pose as a biologist 🔬 , 
##### some days I am pretending to write codes in R 💻 and some days I am trying to befriend statisticians ❗ 
##### If you catch me day-dreaming, I am thinking about open science and why we do science the way we do it ..
