### Hi there 👋
## I am Shreya (she/her), a PhD Student in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Bielefeld University , Germany!
## I am currently working with evidence synthesis methodology (meta-analysis/systematic reviews) 
## I am a supreme imposter - some days I pose as a biologist 🔬 , some days I am pretending to write codes in R 💻 and some days I am trying to befriend statisticians ❗
